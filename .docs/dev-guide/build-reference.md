How to build REX-Ray

---

## Build Requirements
This project has very few build requirements, but there are still one or two
items of which to be aware. Also, please note that these are the requirements to
*build* REX-Ray, not run it.

Requirement | Version
------------|--------
Operating System | Linux, OS X
[Go](https://golang.org/) | >=1.6
[GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) | >=3.80

OS X ships with a very old version of GNU Make, and a package manager like
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) can be used to install the required version.

## Cross-Compilation
This project's [`Makefile`](https://github.com/emccode/rexray/blob/master/Makefile)
is configured by default to build for a Linux x86_64 target, but
cross-compilation *is* supported. Therefore the build environment should be
configured to support cross-compilation. Please take a minute to read
this [blog post](http://dave.cheney.net/2015/08/22/cross-compilation-with-go-1-5)
regarding cross-compilation with Go >=1.5.

## Build Binary
Building from source is pretty simple as all steps, including fetching
dependencies (as well as fetching the tool that fetches dependencies), are
configured as part of the included `Makefile`.

### Build Dependencies
The `make deps` command should be executed prior to any other targets in order
to ensure the necessary dependencies are available.

```sh
$ make deps
target: deps

### Basic Build
The most basic build can be achieved by simply typing `make` from the project's
root directory. For what it's worth, executing `make` sans arguments is the
same as executing `make install` for this project's `Makefile`.

```sh
$ make
SemVer: 0.4.0-rc4+10+dirty
RpmVer: 0.4.0+rc4+10+dirty
Branch: release/0.4.0-rc4
Commit: d2f0283c7fed29ad0a142a6a51624828893f5db5
Formed: Wed, 15 Jun 2016 16:53:44 CDT

target: fmt
  ...formatting rexray...SUCCESS!
target: install
  ...installing rexray Darwin-x86_64...SUCCESS!

The REX-Ray binary is 40MB and located at:

  /Users/akutz/Projects/go/bin/rexray
```

### Binary Size
Please note that the large size of the binary is due to the Isilon
storage adapter's dependency on the
[VMware VMOMI library for Go](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi). The types
definition source in that package compiles to a 45MB, uncompressed archive.
Efforts are being made to figure out an alternative to this dependency in order
to reduce the binary size, even if it means creating VMware SOAP messages from
scratch.

### Build All
In order to build all versions of the binary type the following:

```sh
$ make build-all
SemVer: 0.4.0-rc4+10
RpmVer: 0.4.0+rc4+10
Branch: release/0.4.0-rc4
Commit: d2f0283c7fed29ad0a142a6a51624828893f5db5
Formed: Wed, 15 Jun 2016 16:42:33 CDT

target: fmt
  ...formatting rexray...SUCCESS!
target: build
  ...building rexray Linux-x86_64...SUCCESS!

The REX-Ray binary is 40MB and located at:

  .build/bin/Linux-x86_64/rexray
```

## Build Packages
The `Makefile` also includes targets that assist in the creation of
distributable packages using the produced artifact.

### Build Tarballs
The `Makefile`'s `build` and `build-all` targets will not only build the binary
in place, but it will also compress the binary as a tarball so it's ready for
deployment. For example, after the `make build-all` above, this is the contents
of the directory `.build/deploy`:

```sh
$ ls .build/deploy
latest/
Linux-x86_64/
```

Looking inside the directory `.build/deploy/Linux-x86_64` reveals:

```sh
$ ls .build/deploy/Linux-x86_64/
rexray-Linux-x86_64-0.4.0-rc4+10.tar.gz
```

### Build RPMs
The `Makefile`'s `rpm-all` target will package the binary as
architecture-specific RPMs when executed on a system that supports the RPM
development environment:

```sh
$ make rpm-all
target: rpm
  ...building rpm x86_64...SUCCESS!

The REX-Ray RPM is 11MB and located at:

  .build/deploy/Linux-x86_64/rexray-0.4.0+rc4+10-1.x86_64.rpm
```

### Build DEBs
The `Makefile`'s `deb-all` target will package the binary as
architecture-specific DEBs when executed on a system that supports the Alien
RPM-to-DEB conversion tools:

```sh
$ make deb-all
target: deb
  ...building deb x86_64...SUCCESS!

The REX-Ray DEB is 9MB and located at:

  .build/deploy/Linux-x86_64/rexray_0.4.0+rc4+10-1_amd64.deb
```

## Version File
There is a file at the root of the project named `VERSION`. The file contains
a single line with the *target* version of the project in the file. The version
follows the format:

  `(?<major>\d+)\.(?<minor>\d+)\.(?<patch>\d+)(-rc\d+)?`

For example, during active development of version `0.4.0` the file would
contain the version `0.4.0`. When it's time to create `0.4.0`'s first
release candidate the version in the file will be changed to `0.4.0-rc1`. And
when it's time to release `0.4.0` the version is changed back to `0.4.0`.

Please note that we've discussed making the actively developed version the
targeted version with a `-dev` suffix, but trying this resulted in confusion
for the RPM and DEB package managers when using `unstable` releases.

So what's the point of the file if it's basically duplicating the utility of a
tag? Well, the `VERSION` file in fact has two purposes:

  1. First and foremost updating the `VERSION` file with the same value as that
     of the tag used to create a release provides a single, contextual reason to
     push a commit and tag. Otherwise some random commit off of `master` would
     be tagged as a release candidate or release. Always using the commit that
     is related to updating the `VERSION` file is much cleaner.

  2. The contents of the `VERSION` file are also used during the build process
     as a means of overriding the output of a `git describe`. This enables the
     semantic version injected into the produced binary to be created using
     the *targeted* version of the next release and not just the value of the
     last, tagged commit.

## Build with Docker
It may be beneficial to build REX-Ray's `Makefile` targets within a Docker container if there are issues with conflicting dependencies during the build process. REX-Ray's `Makefile` is configured to optionally allow specific targets to be built within a Docker container. The following targets are supported: `make`, `make tgz`, `make rpm`, `make deb`, `make clean`, and `make pkg-clean`.

To build these targets with Docker, make sure [`GOPATH`](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) is set properly, and `BUILD_WITH_DOCKER` is set to `1`:

```sh
export BUILD_WITH_DOCKER=1
```

Building any of the supported `Makefile` targets will build a Docker image based on the `Dockerfile` in REX-Ray's root directory, and run the respective commands within a Docker container based on this Docker image.

The resulting artifacts will be placed in the same locations as if they were built without Docker.

### Build Directly with Dockerfile
It is not required to build the Docker image and directly run a Docker container before building a target with Docker, as the `Makefile` will automatically do so. However, it is possible to do so, and the produced Docker container will run the following by default:

```sh
make clean \
&& make deps \
&& env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 make build \
&& env GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 make build \
&& make tgz \
&& make RPMBUILD='fakeroot rpmbuild' rpm \
&& make deb
```

To begin, assuming:
- Your GitHub username is `ghjanedoe`
- Your REX-Ray fork is checked out in `$HOME/go/src/github.com/ghjanedoe/rexray/`

First, make sure the `Dockerfile` is in `$HOME/go/src/github.com/ghjanedoe/rexray/`, and [`GOPATH`](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) is set to `$HOME/go`.

Then build a Docker image, for instance called `docker-make-rexray` using REX-Ray's `Dockerfile` by:
```sh
docker build -t docker-make-rexray .
```

To run a Docker container using the image `docker-make-rexray`:

```sh
docker run -e LOCAL_GOPATH=$GOPATH \
-v $HOME/go/src/github.com/ghjanedoe/rexray/:/go/src/github.com/emccode/rexray/ \
-v $HOME/go/pkg/:/go/pkg/ \
-v $HOME/go/bin/:/go/bin/ \
-w=/go/src/github.com/emccode/rexray/ docker-make-rexray
```

Note that `RPMBUILD='fakeroot rpmbuild'` must be specified when building RPMs within the Docker container. This is automatically handled in the Dockerfile's default `CMD` and within the `Makefile` when running `make rpm` after setting `BUILD_WITH_DOCKER=1`. However, when directly running the Docker container without the `Makefile` and overriding the default `CMD` with `docker run`, use `make RPMBUILD='fakeroot rpmbuild' rpm` instead of `make rpm`. For example:

```sh
docker run -e LOCAL_GOPATH=$GOPATH \
-v $HOME/go/src/github.com/ghjanedoe/rexray/:/go/src/github.com/emccode/rexray/ \
-w=/go/src/github.com/emccode/rexray/ docker-make-rexray /bin/bash -c "make RPMBUILD='fakeroot rpm' rpm"
```

The produced artifacts will be located as follows:
- The rexray binaries are created on your local machine in `$HOME/go/bin/rexray` and in `$HOME/go/bin/darwin_amd64/rexray`.
- `*.tar.gz` is created on your local machine in `$HOME/go/src/github.com/emccode/rexray/`.
- `*.rpm` is created on your local machine in `$HOME/go/src/github.com/emccode/rexray/`.
- `*.deb` is created on your local machine in` $HOME/go/src/github.com/emccode/rexray/`.

### Resuming Builds without Docker
To build without using Docker after having built with Docker, make sure to reset `BUILD_WITH_DOCKER` to not be equal to `1`; for instance:

```sh
export BUILD_WITH_DOCKER=0
```

Note that files created by Docker containers are owned by `root`; thus, file permission errors may occur if dependencies and builds were initially created within Docker, and subsequent builds are made without Docker. If so, then it may be necessary to change the ownership on files within the `GOPATH` to be your non-root user.

First, verify that `$USER` corresponds with your current user:

```sh
echo $USER
```

Then, use the following command to change ownership on files within the `GOPATH` to `$USER`:

```sh
sudo find $GOPATH -group root -print0 -exec chown -hR $USER:$USER {} +
```
