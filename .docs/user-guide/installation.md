# Installation

Getting the bits, bit by bit

---

## Overview
There are several different methods available for installing REX-Ray. It
is written in Go, so there are typically no dependencies that must be installed
alongside its single binary file. The manual methods can be extremely simple
through tools like `curl`. You also have the opportunity to perform install
steps individually. Following the manual installs, [configuration](./config.md)
must take place.

Great examples of automation tools, such as `Ansible` and `Puppet`, are also
provided. These approaches automate the entire configuration process.

## Manual Installs
Manual installations are in contrast to batch, automated installations.

Make sure that before installing REX-Ray that you have uninstalled any previous
versions. A `rexray uninstall` can assist with this where appropriate.

Following an installation and configuration, you can use REX-Ray interactively
through commands like `rexray volume`. Noticeably different from this is having
REX-Ray integrate with Container Engines such as Docker. This requires that
you run `rexray start` or relevant service start command like
`systemctl start rexray`.


### Install via curl
The following command will download the most recent, stable build of REX-Ray
and install it to `/usr/bin/rexray` or `/opt/bin/rexray`. On Linux systems
REX-Ray will also be registered as either a SystemD or SystemV service.

There is an optional flag to choose which version to install. Notice how we
specify `stable`, see the additional version names below that are also valid.

```shell
curl -sSL https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/install | sh -s -- stable
```

### Install a pre-built binary
There are a handful of necessary manual steps to properly install REX-Ray
from pre-built binaries.

#### REX-Ray 0.3.3

!!! note "note"

    The initial REX-Ray 0.4.x release omits support for several,
    previously verified storage platforms. These providers will be
    reintroduced incrementally, beginning with 0.4.1. If an absent driver
    prevents the use of REX-Ray, please continue to use 0.3.3 until such time
    the storage platform is introduced in REX-Ray 0.4.x. The following command
    can be used to explicitly install REX-Ray 0.3.3:

    ```
    curl -sSL https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/install | sh -s -- stable 0.3.3
    ```

1. Download the proper binary. There are also pre-built binaries available for
the various release types.

    Version  | Description
    ---------|------------
    [Unstable](https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/unstable/latest/) | The most up-to-date, bleeding-edge, and often unstable REX-Ray binaries.
    [Staged](https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/staged/latest/) | The most up-to-date, release candidate REX-Ray binaries.
    [Stable](https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/stable/latest/) | The most up-to-date, stable REX-Ray binaries.

2. Uncompress and move the binary to the proper location. Preferably `/usr/bin`
should be where REX-Ray is moved, but this path is not required.
3. Install as a service with `rexray install`. This will register itself
with SystemD or SystemV for proper initialization.

### Build and install from source
It is also easy to build REX-Ray from source.

!!! note "note"

    REX-Ray requires at least Go 1.6.0. The REX-Ray developers use Go 1.6.2,
    and that is what REX-Ray's Travis-CI build uses as well. The build
    reference for REX-Ray is available in the
    [Developer's Guide](/dev-guide/build-reference.md).

```sh
# go get the rexray repo using the -d flag to enable "download only" mode
go get -d github.com/emccode/rexray

# change directories into the freshly-cloned repo
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/emccode/rexray

# get and build REX-Ray's dependencies and then build and install REX-Ray
make deps && make
```

Once REX-Ray is built and installed it will be available at
`$GOPATH/bin/rexray`:

```sh
$ $GOPATH/bin/rexray version
REX-Ray

```

## Automated Installs
Because REX-Ray is simple to install using the `curl` script, installation
using configuration management tools is relatively easy as well. However,
there are a few areas that may prove to be tricky, such as writing the
configuration file.

This section provides examples of automated installations using common
configuration management and orchestration tools.

### Ansible
With Ansible, installing the latest REX-Ray binaries can be accomplished by
including the `emccode.rexray` role from Ansible Galaxy.  The role accepts
all the necessary variables to properly fill out your `config.yml` file.

Install the role from Galaxy:

```sh
$ ansible-galaxy install emccode.rexray
```

Example playbook for installing REX-Ray on GCE Docker hosts:

```yaml
- hosts: gce_docker_hosts
  roles:
  - { role: emccode.rexray,
      rexray_service: true,
      rexray_storage_drivers: [gce],
      rexray_gce_keyfile: "/opt/gce_keyfile" }
```

Run the playbook:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory> playbook.yml
```

### AWS CloudFormation
With CloudFormation, the installation of the latest Docker and REX-Ray binaries
can be passed to the orchestrator using the 'UserData' property in a
CloudFormation template. While the payload could also be provided as raw user
data via the AWS GUI, it would not sustain scalable automation.

```json
"Properties": {
  "UserData": {
    "Fn::Base64": {
      "Fn::Join": ["", [
        "#!/bin/bash -xe\n",
        "apt-get update\n",
        "apt-get -y install python-setuptools\n",
        "easy_install https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/aws-cfn-bootstrap-latest.tar.gz\n",
        "ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/aws_cfn_bootstrap-1.4-py2.7.egg/init/ubuntu/cfn-hup /etc/init.d/cfn-hup\n",
        "chmod +x /etc/init.d/cfn-hup\n",
        "update-rc.d cfn-hup defaults\n ",
        "service cfn-hup start\n",
        "/usr/local/bin/cfn-init --stack ", {
          "Ref": "AWS::StackName"
        }, " --resource RexrayInstance ", " --configsets InstallAndRun --region ", {
          "Ref": "AWS::Region"
        }, "\n",

        "# Install the latest Docker..\n",
        "/usr/bin/curl -o /tmp/install-docker.sh https://get.docker.com/\n",
        "chmod +x /tmp/install-docker.sh\n",
        "/tmp/install-docker.sh\n",

        "# add the ubuntu user to the docker group..\n",
        "/usr/sbin/usermod -G docker ubuntu\n",

        "# Install the latest REX-ray\n",
        "/usr/bin/curl -ssL -o /tmp/install-rexray.sh https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/install\n",
        "chmod +x /tmp/install-rexray.sh\n",
        "/tmp/install-rexray.sh\n",
        "chgrp docker /etc/rexray/config.yml\n",
        "reboot\n"
      ]]
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Machine (VirtualBox)
SSH can be used to remotely deploy REX-Ray to a Docker Machine. While the
following example used VirtualBox as the underlying storage platform, the
provided `config.yml` file *could* be modified to use any of the supported
drivers.

1. SSH into the Docker machine and install REX-Ray.

        $ docker-machine ssh testing1 \
        "curl -sSL https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/install | sh"

2. Install the udev extras package. This step is only required for versions of
   boot2docker older than 1.10.

        $ docker-machine ssh testing1 \
        "wget http://tinycorelinux.net/6.x/x86_64/tcz/udev-extra.tcz \
        && tce-load -i udev-extra.tcz && sudo udevadm trigger"

3. Create a basic REX-Ray configuration file inside the Docker machine.

    **Note**: It is recommended to replace the `volumePath` parameter with the
    local path VirtualBox uses to store its virtual media disk files.

        $ docker-machine ssh testing1 \
            "sudo tee -a /etc/rexray/config.yml << EOF
            libstorage:
              integration:
                volume:
                  operations:
                    mount:
                      preempt: false
            virtualbox:
              volumePath: $HOME/VirtualBox/Volumes
            "

4. Finally, start the REX-Ray service inside the Docker machine.

        $ docker-machine ssh testing1 "sudo rexray start"

### OpenStack Heat
Using OpenStack Heat, in the HOT template format (yaml):

```yaml
resources:
  my_server:
    type: OS::Nova::Server
    properties:
      user_data_format: RAW
      user_data:
        str_replace:
          template: |
            #!/bin/bash -v
            /usr/bin/curl -o /tmp/install-docker.sh https://get.docker.com
            chmod +x /tmp/install-docker.sh
            /tmp/install-docker.sh
            /usr/sbin/usermod -G docker ubuntu
            /usr/bin/curl -ssL -o /tmp/install-rexray.sh https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/install
            chmod +x /tmp/install-rexray.sh
            /tmp/install-rexray.sh
            chgrp docker /etc/rexray/config.yml
          params:
            dummy: ""
```

### Vagrant
Using Vagrant is a great option to deploy pre-configured REX-Ray nodes,
including Docker, using the VirtualBox driver. All volume requests are handled
using VirtualBox's Virtual Media.

A Vagrant environment and instructions using it are provided
[here](https://github.com/emccode/vagrant/tree/master/rexray).

### Containerizing REX-Ray (Dockerizing)
Using `REX-Ray` in a docker container is a great option to quickly get it up and running. The following section discusses the steps to create and launch a docker container that launches `REX-Ray`.

#### Create Docker Container

Here's a Dockerfile for creating a `REX-Ray` image

```
FROM ubuntu:15.10

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget

RUN wget https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/stable/0.3.2/rexray-Linux-x86_64-0.3.2.tar.gz -O rexray.tar.gz && tar -xvzf rexray.tar.gz -C /usr/bin

ENTRYPOINT ["rexray"]

CMD ["--help"]

```

1. Start with a base image (In the example, `ubuntu:15.10` is used)
2. Add rexray into path - In this case, the image (v0.3.2) is downloaded from bintray
3. Execute the binary, In this case, the default help message is printed

#### Launch `REX-Ray` container

While launching `REX-Ray` container, the following volumes need to be bind mounted

- `/etc/rexray:/etc/rexray`
- `/var/lib/rexray:/var/lib/rexray:shared` (the `shared` flag is vital here)
- `/var/run/rexray:/var/run/rexray`
- `/var/log/rexray:/var/log/rexray`
- `/run/docker/plugins:/run/docker/plugins`
- ... (any others required by drivers, e.g. EBS requires `/dev:/dev`)

The first bind mount is used to present the `config.yml` file to `REX-Ray`. The host path `/etc/rexray/` should have the `config.yml` file in it.

The second bind mount has a special flag (`shared`). The mounts that happen within a container do not propagate by default into the host. i.e. if the `REX-Ray` container mounted a new volume inside `/var/lib/rexray`, it wont show up in the host path `/var/lib/rexray` even if it was bind mounted into the container. The `shared` flag makes it possible to share the mounts across namespaces(container & host). 

NOTE: `shared` bind mounting feature is available in Docker versions 1.10 and above

Once the image is created, and executed, the `rexray` volume driver can be used to persist data in any container.
e.g. `docker run --volume-driver rexray -v test:/test -it ubuntu:14.04.3`
